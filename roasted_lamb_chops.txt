    two 1-lb (450g) racks lamb, frenched
    kosher salt and cracked black pepper
    1/3 cup plus 1 tbsp olive oil, plus more for searing
    1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
    6 cloves garlic, 4 peeled and smashed, 2 finely chopped
    juice of 1 lemon
    3 tbsp dijon mustard
    2 tbsp honey
    1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs
    1/3 cup grated parmesan
    2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
    1 tbsp thinly sliced fresh chives

Directions

1. Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper and place in a gallon-size zip-top bag.

2. Whisk 1/3 cup of the olive oil, the rosemary, smashed garlic, lemon juice and some salt and pepper together in a
measuring cup. Pour the marinade into the bag with the lamb. Let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up
to 3 hours.

3. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Line a heavy-duty sheet tray with foil.

4. Combine the mustard and honey together in a small bowl and set aside. Add the panko, Parmesan, parsley, chives and
the remaining 2 cloves garlic to a small bowl and toss together. Drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of oil and mix together.

5. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and once very hot, sear the lamb, 1 rack at a time,
fat-side down first, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and place fat-side up on the prepared sheet tray.

6. Brush both racks with the honey mustard and apply each with the panko and herb mixture. Roast the lamb until an
instant-read thermometer reads 60 degrees C, for medium, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before carving into chops.

Cook's Note: If marinating the lamb for 3 hours, place in the refrigerator. Let it come back up to room temperature 30
minutes before cooking.
